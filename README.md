## 🎯 The Problem

Open-source maintainers face **notification fatigue**. With 50+ stuck PRs and hundreds of issues, they spend hours:
- Writing the same follow-up messages repeatedly
- Manually tracking which PRs need attention
- Guessing at project health trends

**OpenSourceHealth** solves this with AI-powered automation and real-time analytics.

---

## ✨ Features

### 🤖 **AI-Powered Smart Nudges** (Gemini Pro)
One-click generation of polite, context-aware follow-up messages for stuck PRs.

```python
# Example: Gemini analyzes PR context and generates:
"Hi @contributor, thanks for the PR! We noticed the build failed on CI. 
Do you need any help debugging the test suite?"
```

**Impact**: Saves 2+ hours/week per repository.

### 📊 **Real-Time Sync with Progress Tracking**
- Async background processing for large repos (handles `supabase/supabase` with 2000+ items)
- Live progress bar with estimated time remaining
- Calculates sync speed (items/sec) for accurate estimates

### 📈 **Interactive Activity Trends**
Beautiful charts (powered by Recharts) showing:
- PR vs Issue velocity over time
- Contributor activity patterns
- Health trend analysis with AI-generated insights

### 🎯 **Actionable Dashboards**
- **Stuck PRs**: Prioritized table of PRs needing attention
- **Contributor Health**: Track new, returning, and churned contributors
- **Issue Triage**: Unanswered issues sorted by urgency
- **PR Review Health**: Identify bottlenecks in your review process

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+
- GitHub Personal Access Token ([Create one](https://github.com/settings/tokens))
- Google AI Studio API Key ([Get one](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey))

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/himanchalkaushale/Contributor-Health-Maintainer-Experience-Dashboard.git
cd Contributor-Health-Maintainer-Experience-Dashboard
```

2. **Backend Setup**
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your GITHUB_TOKEN and GEMINI_API_KEY
```

3. **Frontend Setup**
```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

4. **Run the Application**

Terminal 1 (Backend):
```bash
cd backend
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Terminal 2 (Frontend):
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

5. **Open your browser**
```
http://localhost:5173
```

> **Schema note:** The contributor analytics feature adds new tables
> (`contribution_events`, `reviews`, `comments`) and populates additional
> columns. There is no migration tooling — tables are created on startup via
> `Base.metadata.create_all`. If you are upgrading an existing database and
> want the new analytics populated from scratch, delete the SQLite database
> first so it is recreated and re-synced:
> ```bash
> # from backend/
> rm sql_app.db sql_app.db-shm sql_app.db-wal   # PowerShell: Remove-Item sql_app.db*
> ```
> Then restart the backend and re-sync each repository. New tables are created
> automatically; only previously-synced data needs a re-sync to backfill events.

## 🎬 Demo

### Adding a Repository
1. Enter `owner/repo` in the top header (e.g., `octocat/Hello-World`)
2. Click sync → Watch real-time progress with time estimates
3. Explore the dashboard once sync completes

### Using Smart Nudge
1. Navigate to **Bottlenecks** page
2. Find a stuck PR in the table
3. Click **✨ Draft Nudge**
4. Gemini generates a ready-to-send message
5. Copy and paste into GitHub!

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Backend (FastAPI)
- **Async GitHub API Integration**: Non-blocking data fetching
- **SQLite with WAL Mode**: Concurrent reads during long syncs
- **Background Task Queue**: Handles large repos without blocking UI
- **Gemini Pro Integration**: Context-aware AI message generation

### Frontend (React + Vite)
- **Real-time Polling**: Live sync status updates every 2 seconds
- **Recharts**: Interactive data visualizations
- **TailwindCSS + GSAP**: Premium UI with smooth animations
- **Context API**: Centralized state management

### Key Technical Decisions
- **`requests` over `httpx`**: Solved SSL/environment issues in production
- **WAL Mode**: Prevents database locking during large syncs
- **Progress Estimation**: Real-time items/sec calculation for accurate ETAs
